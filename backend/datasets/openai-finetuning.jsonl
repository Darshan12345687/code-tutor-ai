We can optimize this by using a \"phone book\" approach - instead of checking everyone, we look up the person directly in an organized directory.\n\n2️⃣ SIMPLE EXPLANATION\n\nO(n²) means the algorithm's time grows quadratically - if you have 10 items, it might do 100 operations. If you have 100 items, it does 10,000 operations! We can optimize by using data structures like hash tables (dictionaries) that allow O(1) lookups instead of O(n) searches.\n\n3️⃣ BEGINNER CODE EXAMPLE\n\n```python\n# ❌ O(n²) - Slow (nested loops)\ndef find_duplicate_slow(arr1, arr2):\n    duplicates = []\n    for item1 in arr1:  # O(n)\n        for item2 in arr2:  # O(n) - nested!\n            if item1 == item2:\n                duplicates.append(item1)\n    return duplicates\n# Time: O(n²) - Very slow for large arrays!\n\n# ✅ O(n) - Fast (using set/dictionary)\ndef find_duplicate_fast(arr1, arr2):\n    # Convert arr2 to set for O(1) lookups\n    arr2_set = set(arr2)  # O(n) to create set\n    duplicates = []\n    for item in arr1:  # O(n)\n        if item in arr2_set:  # O(1) lookup!\n            duplicates.append(item)\n    return duplicates\n# Time: O(n) - Much faster!\n```\n\n4️⃣ ADVANCED EXAMPLE\n\n```python\n# Original O(n²) approach\ndef two_sum_naive(nums, target):\n    for i in range(len(nums)):  # O(n)\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):  # O(n)\n            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:\n                return [i, j]\n    return []\n# Time: O(n²), Space: O(1)\n\n# Optimized O(n) approach\ndef two_sum_optimized(nums, target):\n    seen = {}  # Hash map for O(1) lookups\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):  # O(n)\n        complement = target - num\n        if complement in seen:  # O(1) lookup\n            return [seen[complement], i]\n        seen[num] = i  # Store index\n    return []\n# Time: O(n), Space: O(n) - trade space for time\n\n# For sorted arrays, use two pointers: O(n log n) sort + O(n) search\ndef two_sum_sorted(nums, target):\n    nums_sorted = sorted(enumerate(nums), key=lambda x: x[1])\n    left, right = 0, len(nums_sorted) - 1\n    while left < right:\n        current_sum = nums_sorted[left][1] + nums_sorted[right][1]\n        if current_sum == target:\n            return [nums_sorted[left][0], nums_sorted[right][0]]\n        elif current_sum < target:\n            left += 1\n        else:\n            right -= 1\n    return []\n```\n\n5️⃣ VISUAL EXPLANATION\n\nO(n²) is like a grid:\n- For 5 items: 5×5 = 25 comparisons\n- For 10 items: 10×10 = 100 comparisons\n- For 100 items: 100×100 = 10,000 comparisons!\n\nO(n) with hashing is like a phone book:\n- Look up \"Smith\" directly in the S section\n- No need to check every name from A to Z\n- Direct access = constant time O(1)\n\n6️⃣ COMMON MISTAKES\n\n❌ Premature optimization:\n```python\n# Don't optimize if n is small!\nif len(arr) < 10:\n    # O(n²) is fine for small arrays\n    return simple_search(arr)\nelse:\n    return optimized_search(arr)\n```\n\n✅ Fix: Profile first, optimize bottlenecks\n\n❌ Using wrong data structure:\n```python\n# Using list for frequent lookups (O(n) each time)\nitems = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nif 5 in items:  # O(n) - checks every element!\n    pass\n```\n\n✅ Fix: Use set for O(1) lookups\n```python\nitems = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  # Set\nif 5 in items:  # O(1) - instant lookup!\n    pass\n```\n\n7️⃣ MINI PRACTICE TASK\n\nGiven two arrays, find all common elements:\n```python\narr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n# Expected: [4, 5]\n```\n\nFirst write the O(n²) version, then optimize it to O(n)!\n\n💡 What level would you like next?
