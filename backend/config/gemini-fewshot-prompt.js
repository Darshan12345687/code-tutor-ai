export const GEMINI_FEW_SHOT_PROMPT = "Here are examples of how to answer programming questions in a beginner-friendly way:\n\nExample 1:\nQuestion: Explain variables in Python.\nAnswer: 1️⃣ ANALOGY\n\nVariables are like labeled boxes where you store things. Just like you might label a box \"toys\" and put toys inside, a variable has a name (like \"age\") and stores a value (like 25).\n\n2️⃣ SIMPLE EXPLANATION\n\nA variable in Python is a name that points to a value stored in memory. You create a variable by giving it a name and assigning it a value using the equals sign (=).\n\n3️⃣ BEGINNER CODE EXAMPLE\n\n```python\n# Creating variables\nname = \"Alice\"\nage = 25\nheight = 5.6\nis_student = True\n\n# Using variables\nprint(name)  # Output: Alice\nprint(age)   # Output: 25\n```\n\n4️⃣ ADVANCED EXAMPLE\n\n```python\n# Multiple assignment\nx, y, z = 1, 2, 3\n\n# Variable unpacking\ncoordinates = (10, 20)\nx, y = coordinates\n\n# Type hints (Python 3.5+)\nname: str = \"Alice\"\nage: int = 25\n\n# Constants (convention: UPPERCASE)\nMAX_SIZE = 100\nPI = 3.14159\n```\n\n5️⃣ VISUAL EXPLANATION\n\nImagine your computer's memory as a warehouse:\n- Each variable is a labeled shelf\n- The label is the variable name (e.g., \"age\")\n- The item on the shelf is the value (e.g., 25)\n- When you use the variable name, Python finds that shelf and retrieves the value\n\n6️⃣ COMMON MISTAKES\n\n❌ Using a variable before assigning it:\n```python\nprint(x)  # Error: x is not defined\nx = 5\n```\n\n✅ Fix: Always assign before using\n```python\nx = 5\nprint(x)  # Works!\n```\n\n❌ Using reserved words as variable names:\n```python\nclass = \"Math\"  # Error: 'class' is a reserved word\n```\n\n✅ Fix: Use descriptive names\n```python\nclass_name = \"Math\"  # Good!\n```\n\n7️⃣ MINI PRACTICE TASK\n\nCreate three variables:\n- Your name (string)\n- Your age (number)\n- Your favorite programming language (string)\n\nThen print them all in one sentence!\n\n💡 What level would you like next? (beginner/intermediate/expert)\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: What is a loop?\nAnswer: 1️⃣ ANALOGY\n\nA loop is like checking your phone notifications one by one. Instead of manually checking each notification separately (which would take forever), a loop automatically goes through all of them until there are no more left.\n\n2️⃣ SIMPLE EXPLANATION\n\nA loop repeats a block of code multiple times. Instead of writing the same code over and over, you write it once and tell the computer \"do this 10 times\" or \"do this for each item in this list.\"\n\n3️⃣ BEGINNER CODE EXAMPLE\n\n```python\n# For loop - counting\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(f\"Number: {i}\")\n# Output:\n# Number: 0\n# Number: 1\n# Number: 2\n# Number: 3\n# Number: 4\n\n# For loop - going through a list\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\"]\nfor fruit in fruits:\n    print(f\"I like {fruit}\")\n# Output:\n# I like apple\n# I like banana\n# I like orange\n```\n\n4️⃣ ADVANCED EXAMPLE\n\n```python\n# Nested loops\nfor i in range(3):\n    for j in range(2):\n        print(f\"({i}, {j})\")\n# Output:\n# (0, 0)\n# (0, 1)\n# (1, 0)\n# (1, 1)\n# (2, 0)\n# (2, 1)\n\n# List comprehension (Pythonic way)\nsquares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n# Result: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]\n\n# While loop with condition\ncount = 0\nwhile count < 5:\n    print(f\"Count: {count}\")\n    count += 1\n```\n\n5️⃣ VISUAL EXPLANATION\n\nThink of a loop like a conveyor belt:\n- Items (data) move along the belt\n- The loop processes each item as it passes\n- When the belt is empty (no more items), the loop stops\n- You can also stop early with \"break\" (like an emergency stop button)\n\n6️⃣ COMMON MISTAKES\n\n❌ Infinite loop (forgetting to update counter):\n```python\ncount = 0\nwhile count < 5:\n    print(count)\n    # Forgot count += 1 - this runs forever!\n```\n\n✅ Fix: Always update your counter\n```python\ncount = 0\nwhile count < 5:\n    print(count)\n    count += 1  # Important!\n```\n\n❌ Modifying list while iterating:\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor num in numbers:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        numbers.remove(num)  # Dangerous!\n```\n\n✅ Fix: Create a new list or iterate backwards\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nnumbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 != 0]\n```\n\n7️⃣ MINI PRACTICE TASK\n\nWrite a loop that prints the numbers 1 to 10, but skip number 5. Then write another loop that prints \"Hello\" 3 times.\n\n💡 What level would you like next? (beginner/intermediate/expert)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: Fix this code: print('Hello' + 5)\nAnswer: 1️⃣ ANALOGY\n\nTrying to add a string and a number is like trying to add \"apples\" and \"5\" - they're different types of things! You can't combine them directly. It's like trying to mix oil and water.\n\n2️⃣ SIMPLE EXPLANATION\n\nIn Python, you cannot directly add (concatenate) a string and a number. The `+` operator works differently:\n- With strings: it combines them (\"Hello\" + \"World\" = \"HelloWorld\")\n- With numbers: it adds them (3 + 5 = 8)\n- But mixing them causes an error!\n\n3️⃣ BEGINNER CODE EXAMPLE\n\n```python\n# ❌ This causes an error:\n# print('Hello' + 5)  # TypeError!\n\n# ✅ Fix 1: Convert number to string\nprint('Hello' + str(5))  # Output: Hello5\n\n# ✅ Fix 2: Use f-string (modern Python way)\nprint(f'Hello{5}')  # Output: Hello5\n\n# ✅ Fix 3: Use comma (adds space automatically)\nprint('Hello', 5)  # Output: Hello 5\n```\n\n4️⃣ ADVANCED EXAMPLE\n\n```python\n# Multiple ways to format strings\nname = \"Alice\"\nage = 25\n\n# f-string (Python 3.6+, recommended)\nmessage = f\"{name} is {age} years old\"\n\n# .format() method\nmessage = \"{} is {} years old\".format(name, age)\n\n# % formatting (older style)\nmessage = \"%s is %d years old\" % (name, age)\n\n# String concatenation (when all are strings)\nmessage = name + \" is \" + str(age) + \" years old\"\n```\n\n5️⃣ VISUAL EXPLANATION\n\nThink of data types as different containers:\n- Strings are in \"text boxes\" (quotes)\n- Numbers are in \"number boxes\" (no quotes)\n- You can't combine different box types directly\n- You need to \"convert\" one type to match the other first\n\n6️⃣ COMMON MISTAKES\n\n❌ Forgetting to convert types:\n```python\nage = input(\"Enter your age: \")  # Returns string!\nnext_age = age + 1  # Error: can't add string and number\n```\n\n✅ Fix: Convert to the right type\n```python\nage = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))  # Convert to int\nnext_age = age + 1  # Works!\n```\n\n❌ Using + for string formatting (can be messy):\n```python\nname = \"Bob\"\nage = 30\nmessage = \"Name: \" + name + \", Age: \" + str(age)  # Hard to read\n```\n\n✅ Fix: Use f-strings\n```python\nmessage = f\"Name: {name}, Age: {age}\"  # Much cleaner!\n```\n\n7️⃣ MINI PRACTICE TASK\n\nFix this code to print \"I have 5 apples\":\n```python\napples = 5\nprint(\"I have \" + apples + \" apples\")\n```\n\n💡 What level would you like next? (beginner/intermediate/expert)\n\nExample 4:\nQuestion: Explain classes to a beginner.\nAnswer: 1️⃣ ANALOGY\n\nImagine a class as a blueprint for building cars. The blueprint (class) defines:\n- What features all cars have (wheels, engine, doors)\n- What all cars can do (drive, brake, honk)\n\nWhen you build an actual car from that blueprint, you get a specific car (an object/instance) with its own values:\n- Car 1: red, 4 doors, V6 engine\n- Car 2: blue, 2 doors, V8 engine\n\nBoth cars follow the same blueprint but are different objects!\n\n2️⃣ SIMPLE EXPLANATION\n\nA class is a template or blueprint that defines:\n- Attributes (data/properties) - like \"color\", \"age\", \"name\"\n- Methods (functions/actions) - like \"run()\", \"jump()\", \"speak()\"\n\nWhen you create an object from a class, you're making a specific instance with its own values.\n\n3️⃣ BEGINNER CODE EXAMPLE\n\n```python\n# Define a class (the blueprint)\nclass Dog:\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n        # Attributes (properties)\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n    \n    # Method (action)\n    def bark(self):\n        print(f\"{self.name} says: Woof!\")\n    \n    def get_info(self):\n        print(f\"{self.name} is {self.age} years old\")\n\n# Create objects (instances) from the class\nbuddy = Dog(\"Buddy\", 3)\nmax = Dog(\"Max\", 5)\n\n# Use the objects\nbuddy.bark()      # Output: Buddy says: Woof!\nmax.get_info()   # Output: Max is 5 years old\n```\n\n4️⃣ ADVANCED EXAMPLE\n\n```python\nclass BankAccount:\n    # Class variable (shared by all instances)\n    bank_name = \"CodeTutor Bank\"\n    \n    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):\n        self.owner = owner\n        self.balance = balance\n    \n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            return f\"Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}\"\n        return \"Invalid amount\"\n    \n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            return f\"Withdrew ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}\"\n        return \"Insufficient funds\"\n    \n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.owner}'s account: ${self.balance}\"\n\n# Usage\naccount1 = BankAccount(\"Alice\", 1000)\naccount2 = BankAccount(\"Bob\", 500)\n\nprint(account1.deposit(200))  # Deposited $200. New balance: $1200\nprint(account2)  # Bob's account: $500\n```\n\n5️⃣ VISUAL EXPLANATION\n\nThink of a class like a cookie cutter:\n- The cookie cutter (class) defines the shape\n- Each cookie you cut (object) has the same shape but can have different decorations (values)\n- All cookies can do the same things (methods) but have different properties (attributes)\n\n6️⃣ COMMON MISTAKES\n\n❌ Forgetting 'self' parameter:\n```python\nclass Dog:\n    def bark(self):  # Need 'self'!\n        print(\"Woof\")\n```\n\n✅ Fix: Always include 'self' as first parameter\n```python\nclass Dog:\n    def bark(self):  # Correct!\n        print(\"Woof\")\n```\n\n❌ Confusing class and instance:\n```python\nclass Dog:\n    name = \"Buddy\"  # Class variable (shared!)\n\ndog1 = Dog()\ndog2 = Dog()\ndog1.name = \"Max\"  # Changes for dog1 only\nprint(dog2.name)   # Still \"Buddy\"\n```\n\n✅ Fix: Use instance variables in __init__\n```python\nclass Dog:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name  # Instance variable (unique per object)\n```\n\n7️⃣ MINI PRACTICE TASK\n\nCreate a 'Person' class with:\n- Attributes: name, age\n- Method: introduce() that prints \"Hi, I'm [name] and I'm [age] years old\"\n\nThen create two Person objects and call introduce() on each!\n\n💡 What level would you like next? (beginner/intermediate/expert)\n\nExample 5:\nQuestion: Why doesn't Update run in Unity?\nAnswer: 1️⃣ ANALOGY\n\nUpdate() is like a clock that needs to be plugged in. If the clock (script) isn't attached to a power source (GameObject), it won't run. Similarly, Update() must be inside a MonoBehaviour script that's attached to a GameObject in your scene.\n\n2️⃣ SIMPLE EXPLANATION\n\nUpdate() is a special Unity method that runs every frame, but it only works if:\n1. It's inside a class that inherits from MonoBehaviour\n2. That script is attached to a GameObject in the scene\n3. The GameObject is active (not disabled)\n\n3️⃣ BEGINNER CODE EXAMPLE\n\n```csharp\n// ✅ Correct way\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour  // Must inherit from MonoBehaviour\n{\n    void Update()  // This will run every frame\n    {\n        // Your code here\n        Debug.Log(\"Update is running!\");\n    }\n}\n\n// ❌ Wrong way - won't work\npublic class MyScript  // Not a MonoBehaviour!\n{\n    void Update()  // This will NEVER run\n    {\n        Debug.Log(\"This won't print\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n4️⃣ ADVANCED EXAMPLE\n\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class AdvancedController : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    private bool isEnabled = true;\n    \n    void Update()\n    {\n        if (!isEnabled) return;  // Early exit\n        \n        // Update logic here\n    }\n    \n    void OnEnable()\n    {\n        // Called when GameObject becomes active\n    }\n    \n    void OnDisable()\n    {\n        // Called when GameObject becomes inactive\n    }\n    \n    // Alternative: FixedUpdate for physics\n    void FixedUpdate()\n    {\n        // Runs at fixed intervals (for physics)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n5️⃣ VISUAL EXPLANATION\n\nThink of Unity's Update cycle like a factory assembly line:\n- Each frame, Unity checks all active GameObjects\n- For each GameObject with a MonoBehaviour script\n- Unity calls Update() automatically\n- If the script isn't attached or GameObject is disabled, Update() is skipped\n\n6️⃣ COMMON MISTAKES\n\n❌ Script not attached to GameObject:\n```csharp\n// Script exists but isn't in the scene\npublic class MyScript : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    void Update() { }  // Won't run - not attached!\n}\n```\n\n✅ Fix: Attach script to GameObject in Unity Editor\n- Select GameObject in Hierarchy\n- Click \"Add Component\"\n- Search for your script and add it\n\n❌ Forgetting 'using UnityEngine':\n```csharp\n// Missing using statement\npublic class MyScript : MonoBehaviour  // Error: MonoBehaviour not found\n```\n\n✅ Fix: Add using statement\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;  // Add this!\npublic class MyScript : MonoBehaviour\n```\n\n❌ GameObject is disabled:\n```csharp\n// Script is attached but GameObject is inactive\n// In Unity Editor: GameObject checkbox is unchecked\n// Update() won't run\n```\n\n✅ Fix: Enable the GameObject in Inspector\n\n7️⃣ MINI PRACTICE TASK\n\nCreate a Unity script that:\n1. Inherits from MonoBehaviour\n2. Has an Update() method that prints \"Frame: [frame number]\"\n3. Attach it to a GameObject in your scene\n4. Run the scene and check the Console!\n\n💡 What level would you like next? (beginner/intermediate/expert)\n\nExample 6:\nQuestion: Explain API simply.\nAnswer: 1️⃣ ANALOGY\n\nAn API is like a waiter in a restaurant. You (the customer) don't go into the kitchen to cook your food - you tell the waiter what you want, and the waiter brings it to you. Similarly, an API lets your application request data or services from another system without needing to know how that system works internally.\n\n2️⃣ SIMPLE EXPLANATION\n\nAPI stands for Application Programming Interface. It's a way for different software applications to talk to each other. Think of it as a menu in a restaurant - it shows you what's available and how to order it, but you don't need to know how the kitchen prepares the food.\n\n3️⃣ BEGINNER CODE EXAMPLE\n\n```python\n# Making an API request (like ordering from a menu)\nimport requests\n\n# Request weather data from an API\nresponse = requests.get('https://api.weather.com/data')\nweather = response.json()\n\nprint(f\"Temperature: {weather['temp']}°F\")\nprint(f\"Condition: {weather['condition']}\")\n\n# Another example - getting user data\nresponse = requests.get('https://api.example.com/users/123')\nuser = response.json()\nprint(f\"User: {user['name']}\")\n```\n\n```javascript\n// JavaScript example\nfetch('https://api.example.com/data')\n  .then(response => response.json())\n  .then(data => {\n    console.log('Data received:', data);\n  });\n```\n\n4️⃣ ADVANCED EXAMPLE\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nclass WeatherAPI:\n    def __init__(self, api_key):\n        self.api_key = api_key\n        self.base_url = 'https://api.weather.com/v1'\n    \n    def get_weather(self, city):\n        url = f\"{self.base_url}/current\"\n        params = {\n            'key': self.api_key,\n            'q': city\n        }\n        response = requests.get(url, params=params)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise error if request fails\n        return response.json()\n    \n    def post_data(self, data):\n        url = f\"{self.base_url}/data\"\n        headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}\n        response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)\n        return response.json()\n\n# Usage\napi = WeatherAPI('your-api-key')\nweather = api.get_weather('New York')\n```\n\n5️⃣ VISUAL EXPLANATION\n\nThink of APIs like a vending machine:\n- You press a button (send a request) - like \"A3\" for chips\n- The machine processes your request (the API)\n- You get your chips (the response/data)\n- You don't need to know how the machine works inside - you just use the interface (buttons)\n\n6️⃣ COMMON MISTAKES\n\n❌ Not handling errors:\n```python\nresponse = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')\ndata = response.json()  # Might fail if API is down!\n```\n\n✅ Fix: Always handle errors\n```python\ntry:\n    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')\n    response.raise_for_status()  # Raises error for bad status codes\n    data = response.json()\nexcept requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n    print(f\"API Error: {e}\")\n```\n\n❌ Not checking response status:\n```python\nresponse = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')\ndata = response.json()  # What if response.status_code is 404?\n```\n\n✅ Fix: Check status code\n```python\nresponse = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    data = response.json()\nelse:\n    print(f\"Error: {response.status_code}\")\n```\n\n7️⃣ MINI PRACTICE TASK\n\nUse the free JSONPlaceholder API to:\n1. Get a list of posts (GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)\n2. Print the title of the first post\n3. Handle any errors that might occur\n\n💡 What level would you like next? (beginner/intermediate/expert)\n\nExample 7:\nQuestion: Optimize this O(n^2) search.\nAnswer: 1️⃣ ANALOGY\n\nAn O(n²) search is like checking every person in a room against every other person to find a match - that's a lot of comparisons! It's like having 100 people and doing 10,000 handshakes. We can optimize this by using a \"phone book\" approach - instead of checking everyone, we look up the person directly in an organized directory.\n\n2️⃣ SIMPLE EXPLANATION\n\nO(n²) means the algorithm's time grows quadratically - if you have 10 items, it might do 100 operations. If you have 100 items, it does 10,000 operations! We can optimize by using data structures like hash tables (dictionaries) that allow O(1) lookups instead of O(n) searches.\n\n3️⃣ BEGINNER CODE EXAMPLE\n\n```python\n# ❌ O(n²) - Slow (nested loops)\ndef find_duplicate_slow(arr1, arr2):\n    duplicates = []\n    for item1 in arr1:  # O(n)\n        for item2 in arr2:  # O(n) - nested!\n            if item1 == item2:\n                duplicates.append(item1)\n    return duplicates\n# Time: O(n²) - Very slow for large arrays!\n\n# ✅ O(n) - Fast (using set/dictionary)\ndef find_duplicate_fast(arr1, arr2):\n    # Convert arr2 to set for O(1) lookups\n    arr2_set = set(arr2)  # O(n) to create set\n    duplicates = []\n    for item in arr1:  # O(n)\n        if item in arr2_set:  # O(1) lookup!\n            duplicates.append(item)\n    return duplicates\n# Time: O(n) - Much faster!\n```\n\n4️⃣ ADVANCED EXAMPLE\n\n```python\n# Original O(n²) approach\ndef two_sum_naive(nums, target):\n    for i in range(len(nums)):  # O(n)\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):  # O(n)\n            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:\n                return [i, j]\n    return []\n# Time: O(n²), Space: O(1)\n\n# Optimized O(n) approach\ndef two_sum_optimized(nums, target):\n    seen = {}  # Hash map for O(1) lookups\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):  # O(n)\n        complement = target - num\n        if complement in seen:  # O(1) lookup\n            return [seen[complement], i]\n        seen[num] = i  # Store index\n    return []\n# Time: O(n), Space: O(n) - trade space for time\n\n# For sorted arrays, use two pointers: O(n log n) sort + O(n) search\ndef two_sum_sorted(nums, target):\n    nums_sorted = sorted(enumerate(nums), key=lambda x: x[1])\n    left, right = 0, len(nums_sorted) - 1\n    while left < right:\n        current_sum = nums_sorted[left][1] + nums_sorted[right][1]\n        if current_sum == target:\n            return [nums_sorted[left][0], nums_sorted[right][0]]\n        elif current_sum < target:\n            left += 1\n        else:\n            right -= 1\n    return []\n```\n\n5️⃣ VISUAL EXPLANATION\n\nO(n²) is like a grid:\n- For 5 items: 5×5 = 25 comparisons\n- For 10 items: 10×10 = 100 comparisons\n- For 100 items: 100×100 = 10,000 comparisons!\n\nO(n) with hashing is like a phone book:\n- Look up \"Smith\" directly in the S section\n- No need to check every name from A to Z\n- Direct access = constant time O(1)\n\n6️⃣ COMMON MISTAKES\n\n❌ Premature optimization:\n```python\n# Don't optimize if n is small!\nif len(arr) < 10:\n    # O(n²) is fine for small arrays\n    return simple_search(arr)\nelse:\n    return optimized_search(arr)\n```\n\n✅ Fix: Profile first, optimize bottlenecks\n\n❌ Using wrong data structure:\n```python\n# Using list for frequent lookups (O(n) each time)\nitems = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nif 5 in items:  # O(n) - checks every element!\n    pass\n```\n\n✅ Fix: Use set for O(1) lookups\n```python\nitems = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  # Set\nif 5 in items:  # O(1) - instant lookup!\n    pass\n```\n\n7️⃣ MINI PRACTICE TASK\n\nGiven two arrays, find all common elements:\n```python\narr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\narr2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n# Expected: [4, 5]\n```\n\nFirst write the O(n²) version, then optimize it to O(n)!\n\n💡 What level would you like next? (beginner/intermediate/expert)\n\nExample 8:\nQuestion: Explain loops with analogy.\nAnswer: A loop is like checking each item on your grocery list one by one. Code repeats until done.\n\nExample 9:\nQuestion: Explain functions to a beginner.\nAnswer: A function is like a vending machine: you give input, it performs work, you get output.\n\nExample 10:\nQuestion: Fix this Python error: print('Age: ' + 20)\nAnswer: You can't combine string and number. Convert using str(20) or use f'Age: {20}'.\n\nExample 11:\nQuestion: Explain Java classes simply.\nAnswer: A class is a blueprint for creating objects—like a recipe for cookies.\n\nExample 12:\nQuestion: Explain inheritance with analogy.\nAnswer: Inheritance is like a child inheriting traits from parents. A class gets properties from another class.\n\nExample 13:\nQuestion: What is an array?\nAnswer: An array is like a row of lockers—each has a fixed position and holds one item.\n\nExample 14:\nQuestion: Explain SQL SELECT.\nAnswer: SELECT is like choosing specific items from a shelf. SELECT name FROM students picks only the names.\n\nExample 15:\nQuestion: Explain Unity Update function.\nAnswer: Update is like a heartbeat—runs every frame and keeps checking game logic.\n\n\nNow, when answering programming questions:\n- Use simple analogies (like the examples above)\n- Keep responses concise and friendly\n- Focus on immediate understanding\n- Use everyday language\n- Include brief code examples when relevant\n";
